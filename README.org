* What

The [[https://github.com/dventimihasura/openapi-ndc][openapi-ndc]] project is a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) demo of a Hasura
Native Data Connector (NDC) for the [[https://github.com/dventimihasura/openapi-mock][openapi-mock]] mock OpenAPI service.

* Why

Both the [[https://github.com/dventimihasura/openapi-ndc][openapi-ndc]] project and [[https://github.com/dventimihasura/openapi-mock][openapi-mock]] projects are for
illustrative purposes only.  They illustrate building a NDC for a
given OpenAPI micro-service.

* How

This NDC is written in Python using [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/][Flask]].

* Steps

The following steps can be followed for local development.

** Step 1:  Install the Python libraries.

#+begin_src bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

** Step 2:  Set up environment variables.

#+begin_src bash
  cat <<EOF > setenv.sh
  export SERVER_HOST= <set to the hostname of the OpenAPI server>
  export SERVER_PORT= <set to the port of the OpenAPI server>
  EOF
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Step 3:  Run the application locally in debug mode.

#+begin_src bash
  flask --debug --app app run
#+end_src
